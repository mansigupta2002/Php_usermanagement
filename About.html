            Cars is a 2006 American animated sports comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney
            Pictures. The film was directed by John Lasseter, co-directed by Joe Ranft, produced by Darla K. Anderson,
            and written by Dan Fogelman, Lasseter, Ranft, Kiel Murray, Phil Lorin, and Jorgen Klubien, and was the final
            film independently produced by Pixar after its purchase by Disney in January 2006. The film features an
            ensemble voice cast of Owen Wilson, Paul Newman (in his final voice acting theatrical film role), Bonnie
            Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin, Michael Wallis, George Carlin, Paul Dooley, Jenifer
            Lewis, Guido Quaroni, Michael Keaton, Katherine Helmond, John Ratzenberger and Richard Petty, while race car
            drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr. (as "Junior"), Mario Andretti, Michael Schumacher and car enthusiast Jay Leno (as
            "Jay Limo") voice themselves.

            Cars is set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic vehicles. The film follows a selfish and
            arrogant young racecar named Lightning McQueen who, on the way to the most important race of his life,
            becomes stranded in a forgotten town along U.S. Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he learns about
            friendship and begins to reevaluate his priorities.

            Development for Cars started in 1998, after finishing the production of A Bug's Life, with a new script
            titled The Yellow Car, which was about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world with Klubien writing.
            It was announced that the producers agreed that it could be the next Pixar film after A Bug's Life,
            scheduled for a 1999 release, particularly around June 4; the idea was later scrapped in favor of Toy Story
            2. Shortly after, production was resumed with major script changes. The film was inspired by Lasseter's
            experiences on a cross-country road trip. Randy Newman composed the film's score, while artists such as
            Sheryl Crow, Rascal Flatts, John Mayer and Brad Paisley contributed to the film's soundtrack.

            Cars premiered on May 26, 2006, at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina and was theatrically
            released in the United States on June 9, to generally positive reviews and commercial success, grossing $462
            million worldwide against a budget of $120 million, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2006. The
            film received two nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Animated Feature, but lost to Happy
            Feet (but won both the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated
            Feature Film). The film was released on DVD on November 7, 2006, on VHS in limited quantities on February
            19, 2007, and on Blu-ray on November 6, 2007. The film was accompanied by the short One Man Band for its
            theatrical and home media releases. The film was dedicated to Joe Ranft, who died in a car crash during the
            film's production.

            The success of Cars launched a multimedia franchise and a series of two sequels produced by Pixar and two
            spin-offs produced by Disneytoon Studios, starting with Cars 2 (2011).
